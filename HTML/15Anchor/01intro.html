    <h1>Anchor</h1>

    <h2>Definition and Usage</h2>
    <p> The &lt;a&gt; tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.</p>
    <p> The most important attribute of the &lt;a&gt; element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's
        destination.</p>
    <p> By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:</p>

    <!-- 
     <li> An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
     <li> A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
     <li> An active link is underlined and red</li>
     <li>An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
     <li></li>
     <li></li>
 -->

    <ul>
        <li> An unvisited link is underlined and blue</li>
        <li> A visited link is underlined and purple</li>
        <li> An active link is underlined and re</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tips and Notes</h2>
    <p> <b> Tip:</b> If the &lt;a> tag has no <strong>href</strong> attribute, it is only a placeholder for a hyperlink.
    </p>
    <p> <b> Tip:</b> A linked page is normally displayed in the current browser window, unless you specify another
        target.</p>
    <p> <b> Tip:</b> Use CSS to style links: CSS Links and CSS Buttons.</p>
